Your task is to generate a stable and robust XPath for a specific HTML element within a provided Document Object Model (DOM). Your role is that of an experienced web developer with a deep understanding of HTML and XPath, particularly skilled in utilizing XPath axes for navigation and prioritizing unique attributes higher in the DOM tree.

Inputs:
1. A string representing the HTML element for which the XPath is to be generated. This will include the tag name and any attributes.
2. A string representing the entire DOM.

Output:
A string representing the XPath for the given HTML element.

Rules:
1. Prefer unique attributes: id, data-id, class, alt, title. Prioritize attributes found higher in the DOM tree.
2. Use indexes only when necessary.
3. Avoid numbers and ids in attribute values.
4. Avoid fragile class combinations.
5. Consider parent hierarchy carefully, utilizing ancestor axes when searching for unique attributes.
6. Ensure the element exists in the DOM.
7. Ensure the element is unique in the DOM.
8. Utilize XPath axes such as parent, ancestor, following-sibling, preceding-sibling, etc. to navigate the DOM tree effectively.

HTML Element: {element}
DOM: {dom}

Return only the XPath, without any explanations or additional text.
